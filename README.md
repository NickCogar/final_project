# Carbon Dioxide Process Reaction Management System

### Project Description
Carbon Dioxide is a very critical compound used in a lot of chemical industries to create desireable products. This management system is for intersted potential process engineers that is looking for a certain reaction for their excess carbon dioxide or determine how much carbon dioixde they will need to form a particular product. The mangemnet system will be able to convert units so that imperial or metric units can be used. The system will also determine if the resulting process will be profitable and if the process is dangerous and will need extra safety precautions. 

### Functions 
A function will be needed to convert units.
A function will be needed to display list of reactions available.
A function will be needed to calculate how much product is made or reactant is needed for the desired process. It will also calculate the profitablility of the process.
A function will track the potential safety concerns of the desired reaction by comparing inputs and reaction descriptions.
